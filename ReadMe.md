# Getting Started

## Stuff you need to have already (prerequisites)
- a code editor (use what works for you or try Atom)
- a Linux, OS X, or Windows system
- a recent install of node.js from http://nodejs.org

## Before you clone this repository
- Make sure you install `Meteor`, the full-stack reactive javascript platform
- Linux and Mac OS X install meteor with `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`
- Windows install from https://install.meteor.com/windows

## Development stuff you should know (FYI)
- Basic git commands http://try.github.io/
- https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ provies a deeper understanding of git and a github workflow

## OK, GO! Give me the code so I can help!
- In your projects directory, run `git clone https://github.com/codeforsanantonio/edwards_aquifer.git`

## GitHub Workflow
- After cloning, `git branch <your-name>`, where <your-name> is a variable.
- Now checkout the branch with `git checkout <your-name>`, where <your-name> is a variable.
- Type `git branch` to confirm that youa re in your `<your-name>` branch.
- Do the following from here on out:
  - Use `git add` to add your new files and edits
  - Commit frequently, writing useful commit messages with `git commit`
  - Do `git pull origin master` to make sure you're up to date.
  - Resolve any possible conflicts
  - Then `git push origin <your-name>` to get your code on GitHub.
  - Issue a pull request
  - Ensure someone else reviews and merges your code.
  - Keep going in this cycle.
